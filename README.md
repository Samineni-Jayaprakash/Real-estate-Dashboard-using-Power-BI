I have successfully created a Real Estate Property Analysis Power BI dashboard with various data transformations and meaningful visualizations. Let's break down the details in simple terms:
Data Import and Transformation:
I started by importing data from an open-source site and used an Excel file in Power BI.
Then, I applied transformations like filtering, removing duplicates, and performed calculations.
Additional steps included adding columns, creating conditional columns, and using aggregate functions.

Measures:
I created two important measures:
Waterfront Status:
Determining if a property is waterfront or not.
Calculating the percentage of waterfront properties.
Renovated Status:
Identifying whether a property has been renovated or not.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Defined KPIs for:
Waterfront properties (Yes/No).
Renovated properties (Yes/No).
Condition of properties (Very Good, Good, Bad).
Utilized a clustered bar chart to represent the number of bedrooms and floors in the properties.
Displayed the properties' construction year using a line chart.
Background Dashboard:
Used a background dashboard prepared in PowerPoint to enhance the overall aesthetics and context.
Filters:
Incorporated filters for the dashboard based on:
1.Year of construction.
2.Renovation status.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, Power BI project successfully transformed and analyzed property data from an open-source site. The dashboard provides valuable insights into property features such as waterfront status, renovation history, and conditions. The KPIs, bar charts, and line charts offer a clear and visually appealing representation of the data. With the inclusion of filters, users can interact with the dashboard to explore specific details based on construction year and renovation status. Overall, project demonstrates a thorough understanding of data analysis and visualization techniques using Power BI.
